#Android-Practice
Android apps made while learning Android dev. All apps except the first one were practice from [Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide](https://www.bignerdranch.com/we-write/android-programming/). 

I started with the first version and I'm now reading the second version, planning to update everything to the latest SDK and features.
